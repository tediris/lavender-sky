# Ideas

# Round Structure
* characters do things once per round, governed by initiative
* enemies can be clumped together into a single initiative roll
* boss monsters might have multiple initiative rolls, indicating multiple turns
 per round
* initiative roll can and should be manipulated by effects mid round by players
 and enemies

# Turn Structure
* draw a card? (because drawing cards is fun? maybe you just start with a hand
and it whittles itself down over the course of the encounter)
* Initial hand size is maybe variable across classes/races/backgrounds
* Allow players to mulligan on the initial draw under normal circumstances
(but maybe being caught unawares by an enemy means you can't mulligan, sort of
like disadvantage)
* maybe allow players to mulligan (switch) 1 card a turn from their deck to hand,
to increase consistency? we don't really want to emphasize constructing decks
that are consistent, rather that the deck is just a summary of their abilities/
adventures/accomplishments
* combat/actions can happen freely through the turn, as long as you have the
resources to do them (Energy + Mana/Rage/Etc)
* Use dice to track resources that persist turn to turn
* Energy is a general resource that all cards/hero powers can consume to
regulate how much you do a turn (6 seconds of real time sort of?)

# Hero (Player/NPC) Card
* lists details: class, stats (HP, Energy (for all classes), Mana/Rage/Etc, Armor,
 Speed (Initiative Bonus), Power/Atk/Etc)
* describe "hero power" like in hearthstone, except this is your basic
attack/block/taunt/etc, or some base spell for mages/healers maybe? Just something
so that you don't feel like you have to blow a powerful spell or resource to do
something small

# Stat Card
* for things like equipment, race/species, blessings/curses, etc
* stack underneath and left of the hero card?
* stats show as + or - and a number, indicating how the base stat
is modified, but this doesn't allow for complicated effects. Hm.

# Combat Mechanics
* Abilities/attacks are either single target, Area of effect, or apply to
subsets of the characters on the field
* When you attack/damage something, there is no return damage like in Hearthstone
or magic - you just do your damage
* Players can choose targets freely, assuming there is no "taunt"
* DM should choose targets for enemies based on the situation and to create
a story

# Status Effects
* can effect the targetability of characters
* taunt, stealth, blessed, barb/spiky (hit back when attacked in melee), poisoned,
armor break, confused (can't target/random targeting), slow/haste (boost/lower initiative)


# Things to Try
* Cards/classes that focus on time/speed manipulation to make turns more exciting
for short bursts
* Story cards that relate to things players have done, can change after use at the
DM's discretion (i.e. broken iron sword --> you find some mysterious soul inside it
--> now equipping it imbues you with the power of some legendary palading or something
--> DM replaces that card with a new one, can use temp cards and print new ones
between sessions)
